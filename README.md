# Electron to AppEngine Sample Application
Sample project to demonstrate how to send data from Particle Electron to a App Engine service. Particle platform provides a framework to send data information to their own cloud service. Using webhooks it is possible to send the data somewhere else, and I choosed Google AppEngine, but this could be done in any other REST API service.

Requirements
============
* Particle Electron Kit with data plan enabled
* Asset Tracker Shield
* External GPS Antenna + SMA to uFL adapter
